# Sumo Smash
Created January 2014  
At the Algonquin College Game Jam 2014  
Ottawa, Ontario

## About the Game
This game was written during the Global Game Jam 2014 at Algonquin College, Ottawa, Ontario.  
It was written and designed by Kevin Griese, Jean-Guy Spencer, Richard Spencer, Anthony Whyte, Evan Dales and Murray Christopherson.  
I have rewritten the code for purposes of stability and cleanliness. The art assets are as they originally were.  
The original SVN repository from the Game Jam is: https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/algonquin-ggj-2014-sumo-smash/  
The Game Jam Game Page: http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/sumo-smash

The game is a simple multiplayer-only Sumo Wrestling game, with bright colours and art, and a heavy emphasis on physics simulation.  
It was written in Unity and was my first fully-developed project using Unity. The scripting is in C#.

The art is copyrighted, and not available for reuse without express consent from Anthony Whyte.  
The audio is from various Creative Commons locations around the Internet, and so is free to use and reuse.  
The code is available for use, reuse and educational purposes, along with being an example of my coding style and quality.
